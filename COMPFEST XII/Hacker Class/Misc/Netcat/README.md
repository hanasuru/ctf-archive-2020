# Netcat [50 pts]

**Category:** Misc
**Solves:** 134

## Description
>During CTF's, sometimes there will be services that players have to connect to in order to get the flag. For web challenges, you can use the browser. However for binary exploitation, cryptography (sometimes), and other problems (forensics, reverse engineering, although it is rare for those challenges to have a service), you need a tool called netcat. Other tools exists, such as the `socket` library in python, however using netcat here should be enough.

Just connect, and you'll get the flag.
